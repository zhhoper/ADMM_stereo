Regularized Least-Squares Surface Reconstruction from Gradient Fields: grad2Surf Version 1.0

This toolbox is for the reconstruction of a surface from its measured gradient field.  It is assumed that the gradient field is corrupted by noise, and thereby the package provides algorithms which compute the least-squares solution to the problem, along with various forms of regularization, including:

1) Spectral Regularization
2) Tikhonov Regularization
3) Constrained Regularization (Dirichlet Boundary Values)
4) Weighted Least-Squares

Examples of these types of regularization and how to use the toolbox are given in the accompanying documentation file: g2sIntro.pdf

This toolbox requires the Discrete Orthogonal Polynomial Toolbox (DOPbox):
